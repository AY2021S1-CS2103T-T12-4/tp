Nuudle is a **desktop app for managing patient records and clinic appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Nuudle can get your patient and appointment scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
