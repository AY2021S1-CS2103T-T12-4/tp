## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatisticsDisplay`, `AppointmentListPanel`, 
`PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `NuudleParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the patient book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PatientBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `PatientBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the patient book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.patientbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 1. Done feature
The mark done feature allows users to mark a specific appointment in the address book as done using `d/` tag and `t/` tag to specify the appointment at a certain time slot.
#### 1.1 Implementation
Command: `done d/DATE t/TIME`

Example Usage: 
* `done d/Monday t/9am`
* `done d/12-12-2020 t/12pm`

The Mark Appointments as Done Feature is facilitated by the `DoneCommand`, which extends the abstract class `Command`, and
the `DoneCommandParser`, which implements the `Parser` interface. Both of these classes are part of the `Logic` component.
Additionally, the command takes in a `DateTimeLoader`, which contains the date and time information of the appointment to mark.

The following is an example usage scenario and how the mark as done mechanism behaves at each step:

1. User types `done d/DATE t/TIME` into the app.

2. The request is handled by `LogicManager#execute(String)`, which then calls and passes the input to the `NuudleParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

3. `NuudleParser` detects the command word `done` in the input string and creates a new `DoneCommandParser` to parse inputs according to the format specified for `DoneCommand`.

4. Input is parsed using the `DoneCommandParser#parse(String)` method, which also performs input validation. The method creates a `DateTimeLoader` using the parsed inputs by calling the constructor of the class `DateTimeLoader`.

5. The `DoneCommandParser` creates a new `DoneCommand` instance with the newly created `DateTimeLoader` object and returns it to `NuudleParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

6. `LogicManager` calls the `DoneCommand#execute(model)` method.

7. `DoneCommand` obtains a copy of the `FilteredAppointmentList` by calling the `Model#getFilteredAppointmentList()` method. 

8. `DoneCommand` returns the appointment `toMark` in the `FilteredAppointmentList`, if there is an appointment in the list starts at the same time with the date and time indicated in the `DateTimeLoader`; Otherwise, throw an 
`APPOINTMENT_DOES_NOT_EXISTS` exception.

9. `DoneCommand` creates another instance of this appointment `doneAppointment` which has a `done` status. 

10. `DoneCommand` replaces the `toMark` with the `doneAppointment` by calling the `Model#setAppointment(target, editedAppointment)`.

11. As a last step, `DoneCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with `SuccessMessage` and returns it to `LogicManager`.


The above process is shown in the following sequence diagram:
![DoneSequenceDiagram](images/DoneSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
![DoneCommandActivityDiagram](images/DoneCommandActivityDiagram.png)

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope
**Target user profile story**:

Namise is a hard working nurse working at a popular dental clinic situated in town and gets appointment calls on an hourly basis. Swarmed with incoming calls, Namise has to make new appointments for new and existing patients while keeping track of the doctor’s schedule at the same time 😞. With the need to juggle multiple tasks at once, Namise is also prone to making careless mistakes in his work due to fatigue.

Being a tech-savvy nurse armed with a commendable experience in unix, Namise prefers to scribble down appointment schedules on paper while on call with his patients to maximise efficiency. This task is further exacerbated with the need to transfer these notes into an excel table manually later in the day.
 
**Target user profile summary**:
*   Nurse working in a highly popular, small scale dental clinic
*   Responsible for scheduling a large number of appointments daily
*   Add new patients to the clinic records
*   Do not entertain walk-ins and only operate on an appointment-basis
*   Required to multi-task (create appointment arrangements with patients over the phone)
*   Prone to carelessness due to the sheer number of appointments to handle
*   Tech-savvy
*   Prefers typing & wants to get things done quickly
*   Tired of transferring appointment details from paper notes to excel
*   Prefers desktop apps over other types
*   Types fast
*   Prefers typing to mouse interactions
*   Reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 

Help nurses **handle and schedule dental appointments for patients** faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app or excel scheduling
