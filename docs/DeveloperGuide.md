## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `LogicManager` implements the `Logic` interface and uses the `NuudleParser` class to parse the user command with the `execute` method.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding or deleting a patient).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the patient book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PatientBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `PatientBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the patient book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the appointment data in json format and read it back.
* can save the appointment data in csv format for archiving.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.patientbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPatientBook`. It extends `PatientBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `patientBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPatientBook#commit()` — Saves the current patient book state in its history.
* `VersionedPatientBook#undo()` — Restores the previous patient book state from its history.
* `VersionedPatientBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone patient book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPatientBook()`, `Model#undoPatientBook()` and `Model#redoPatientBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPatientBook` will be initialized with the initial patient book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single patient book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitPatientBook()`, causing the modified state of the patient book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `PatientBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted patient book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitPatientBook()`, causing another modified patient book state to be saved into the `patientBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPatientBook()`, so the patient book state will not be saved into the `patientBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoPatientBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous patient book state, and restores the patient book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial PatientBook state, then there are no previous PatientBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoPatientBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoPatientBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the patient book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `patientBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest patient book state, then there are no undone PatientBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoPatientBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the patient book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all patient book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire patient book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


### 5. Edit Patient Feature

`[written by: Xin Zhe]`

The Edit Patient Feature allows the nurse to edit an existing `Patient` in the patient book. 
`Appointment` which involves the patient will be updated accordingly.

#### 5.1 Implementation

The Edit Patient Feature is facilitated by the `EditCommand`, which extends the abstract class `Command`, 
and the `EditCommandParser`, which implements the `Parser` interface. All of these classes are part of the `Logic` component.

This feature is supported by the `UniquePatientList` which stores the `patient` instances and the `UniqueAppointmentList` 
which stores the `appointment` instances. These classes are part of the `model` component.

Additionally, a public static class `EditPatientDescriptor` is nested in `EditCommand` as a container class to store the details to edit the `Patient` with.
It also implements the following operations:

* `EditCommand#createEditedPatient(Patient patientToEdit, EditPatientDescriptor editPatientDescriptor)` — 
Creates a `patient` with the details of `patientToEdit` edited with `editPatientDescriptor`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user types `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [i/NRIC] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…` into Nuudle.

Step 2: The request is handled by `LogicManager#execute(String)`, which then calls and passes the input to the `NuudleParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

Step 3: `NuudleParser` detects the command word `edit` in the input string and creates a new `EditCommandParser` to parse inputs according to the format specified for `EditCommand`.

Step 4: Input is parsed using the EditCommandParser#parse(String) method, which also performs input validation. The method creates a `EditPatientDescriptor` using the parsed inputs by calling the static constructor inside `EditCommand`.

Step 5: The `EditCommandParser` creates a new `EditCommand` instance with the given index and newly created `EditPatientDescriptor` object and returns it to `NuudleParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6: `LogicManager` calls the `EditCommand#execute(Model)` method.

Step 7: `EditCommand` obtains a copy of the `FilteredPatientList` by calling the `Model#getFilteredPatientList()` method. This is used to check if the `patient` index supplied by the user exists in Nuudle.

Step 8: `EditCommand` creates a new `patient` specified by the `EditPatientDescriptor` by calling its own private static method `EditCommand#createEditedPatient(Patient patientToEdit, EditPatientDescriptor editPatientDescriptor)`.

Step 9: `EditCommand` checks whether there are duplicate patients in the patient book by calling `Model#hasPatient(Patient)` method.

Step 10: `EditCommand` edits the `patient` at a given index by calling `Model#setPatient(Patient, Patient)`;

Step 11: `EditCommand` edits the `appointment` in the `UniqueAppointmentList` which contains the edited patient by calling `Model#updateAppointmentsWithPatient(Patient, Patient)` method.

Step 12: `EditCommand` updates the filtered list by calling `Model#updateFilteredPatientList(Predicate)` method.

Step 13: `EditCommand` updates the filtered list by calling `Model#updateFilteredAppointmentList(Predicate)` method.

Step 14: Lastly, `EditCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with `SuccessMessage` and `Patient` and returns it to `LogicManager`.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope
**Target user profile story**:

Namise is a hard working nurse working at a popular dental clinic situated in town and gets appointment calls on an hourly basis. Swarmed with incoming calls, Namise has to make new appointments for new and existing patients while keeping track of the doctor’s schedule at the same time 😞. With the need to juggle multiple tasks at once, Namise is also prone to making careless mistakes in his work due to fatigue.

Being a tech-savvy nurse armed with a commendable experience in unix, Namise prefers to scribble down appointment schedules on paper while on call with his patients to maximise efficiency. This task is further exacerbated with the need to transfer these notes into an excel table manually later in the day.
 
**Target user profile summary**:
*   Nurse working in a highly popular, small scale dental clinic
*   Responsible for scheduling a large number of appointments daily
*   Add new patients to the clinic records
*   Do not entertain walk-ins and only operate on an appointment-basis
*   Required to multi-task (create appointment arrangements with patients over the phone)
*   Prone to carelessness due to the sheer number of appointments to handle
*   Tech-savvy
*   Prefers typing & wants to get things done quickly
*   Tired of transferring appointment details from paper notes to excel
*   Prefers desktop apps over other types
*   Types fast
*   Prefers typing to mouse interactions
*   Reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 

Help nurses **handle and schedule dental appointments for patients** faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app or excel scheduling
