## Project: Nuudle

Nuudle is a **desktop app for managing patient records and clinic appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Nuudle can get your patient and appointment scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
